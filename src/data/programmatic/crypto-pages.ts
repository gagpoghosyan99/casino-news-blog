    h1: "Bitcoin Casino Payment Guide",
    intro:
      "Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most recognised cryptocurrency for offshore casino deposits when Indian UPI or wallet rails fail. This guide explains how BTC casino payments work, how many confirmations operators may require, why withdrawals are usually irreversible, and how to manage volatility without treating crypto as a guaranteed payment rail.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Why Indian Players Use Bitcoin at Casinos",
        body: "UPI and wallet merchants often block gambling categories. Bitcoin transfers settle on a public blockchain without Indian banking intermediaries — when an operator supports BTC, deposits may credit after network confirmations. BTC is not anonymous in practice: exchanges, casinos, and KYC checks can link addresses to identities. Legal status of online casino play still varies by jurisdiction.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How Bitcoin Casino Deposits Work",
        body: "Typical flow: open the casino cashier, select Bitcoin, copy the deposit address (and any memo/tag if shown), send BTC from your wallet or exchange, wait for confirmations, then check balance. Always send a small test transaction first. Never use addresses from Telegram agents or unofficial support chats — only the logged-in cashier.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Transaction Confirmations Explained",
        body: "Miners include your transaction in blocks. Casinos often require one to six confirmations before crediting — policy varies by operator and amount. Unconfirmed deposits can disappear if the network rejects a double-spend attempt. If balance is missing after your wallet shows confirmations, contact support with the transaction ID (TXID).",
      },
      {
        heading: "Bitcoin Withdrawal Process",
        body: "Withdrawals usually require completed KYC on first cashout. The casino broadcasts BTC to your wallet address after internal review. Timing may include compliance queues plus block confirmation time. Bitcoin casino withdrawals are generally irreversible once confirmed — verify the destination address character by character.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Network Congestion and Fees",
        body: "Bitcoin fees rise when mempool demand is high. Small deposits can lose a large percentage to fees during congestion. Some players time withdrawals for quieter periods; others use Lightning where supported (see below). CasinoPulse does not guarantee fee estimates — check your wallet before sending.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Volatility and Bankroll Planning",
        body: "BTC price moves against INR and USD while you play. A stable INR bankroll in BTC terms can shrink or grow independently of casino results. Some players mentally convert to fiat; others accept BTC denomination risk. Never treat crypto appreciation as a substitute for responsible limits.",

      {
        heading: "Security and Cold Storage Basics",
        body: "Use reputable wallets, enable 2FA on exchange and casino accounts, and avoid storing large balances on hot wallets or exchange accounts long term. Cold storage (hardware wallets) suits savings — not necessarily same-day casino deposits. Never share seed phrases. Phishing sites impersonating casinos are common — bookmark official domains.",

        heading: "Lightning Network Overview",
        body: "Lightning enables faster, lower-fee Bitcoin payments on a second layer. Few international casinos support Lightning directly today — most use on-chain BTC. If Lightning appears in a cashier, understand channel liquidity limits and that not all wallets support the same Lightning implementations. Treat Lightning as optional, not standard.",

        heading: "Ethereum Withdrawals",
        body: "Casinos typically send ETH or ERC-20 tokens to your external address after review. You pay no gas on receipt, but moving funds later costs gas. Withdrawal minimums and KYC may apply. Test with a small cashout after verification.",
